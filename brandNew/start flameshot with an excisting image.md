In Qt, you can convert an image to a QPixmap by using the QPixmap constructor that takes a file path as an argument. Here is a code example:

```cpp
#include <QPixmap>

// ...

QString imagePath = "/path/to/your/image.jpg";
QPixmap pixmap(imagePath);
```

If the path to the image is stored in a `std::string` or `const char*`, you need to convert it to a `QString`:

```cpp
#include <QPixmap>
#include <QString>

// ...

std::string imagePathStd = "/path/to/your/image.jpg";
QString imagePathQt = QString::fromStdString(imagePathStd);
QPixmap pixmap(imagePathQt);
```

Ensure that the file path is correct and the image file is accessible. If the image cannot be read (due to an incorrect path or unsupported format), a null QPixmap will be constructed. You can check if a QPixmap is null by calling the `isNull()` method:

```cpp
if (pixmap.isNull()) {
    // The image file could not be loaded.
}
```
