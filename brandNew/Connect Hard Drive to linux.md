The error you're encountering is due to a lack of permission to mount the NTFS filesystem. The NTFS-3G driver, which allows Linux systems to read and write to NTFS partitions, operates in a user-space filesystem (FUSE), meaning it runs in user mode rather than kernel mode. By default, only root (or a user with sudo privileges) can mount filesystems in Linux. 

However, you can change the permissions of the NTFS-3G binary to allow non-root users to mount NTFS filesystems. Be aware that this could potentially lead to security risks, as it grants more privileges to regular users. Here's how you can do it:

1. Change the ownership of the NTFS-3G binary to root:

    ```bash
    sudo chown root $(which ntfs-3g)
    ```

2. Set the user ID on execution (setuid) permission for the NTFS-3G binary:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 4755 $(which ntfs-3g)
    ```

The above commands make the NTFS-3G binary setuid-root, allowing it to run with root privileges regardless of who executes it. 

Alternatively, you can also restrict this access to a specific group of users, instead of allowing all users to mount NTFS filesystems. Here's how:

1. Create a new group (for example, `ntfsuser`):

    ```bash
    sudo addgroup ntfsuser
    ```

2. Change the ownership of the NTFS-3G binary to root and the new group:

    ```bash
    sudo chown root:ntfsuser $(which ntfs-3g)
    ```

3. Set the user ID and group ID on execution (setuid and setgid) permissions for the NTFS-3G binary:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod 4750 $(which ntfs-3g)
    ```

4. Add the allowed user to the `ntfsuser` group:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG ntfsuser allowed-user
    ```

Replace `allowed-user` with the username of the user you want to allow to mount NTFS filesystems.

Remember, these changes should be made with caution, considering the potential security implications [Source 0](https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g/wiki/NTFS-3G-FAQ).
