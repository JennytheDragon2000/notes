In your code, an anonymous class is used here:

```java
toolbar.setStringListener(new StringListener() {
   public void textEmitted(String text) {
       textPanel.appendText(text);
   }
});
```

Here, an anonymous class is created that implements the `StringListener` interface. This class has a single method `textEmitted`, which appends the emitted text to the `textPanel`.

Why use an anonymous class in this case? Well, for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Anonymous classes allow you to define a class and create an instance of it in a single statement. This makes the code more concise.

2. **Scope**: Anonymous classes are only visible within the block of code where they are defined. This can help to limit the scope of the class and prevent it from being used elsewhere in your code, which can be beneficial for keeping your code clean and easy to understand.

3. **Single use**: Because an anonymous class is typically defined and used in the same place, it doesn't need a name or to be reused elsewhere. This makes sense in this scenario, because you're only ever going to use this particular implementation of `StringListener` in this one place.

However, it's worth noting that while anonymous classes can be very useful, they aren't suitable for every situation. For example, if you want to reuse a class in multiple places in your code, or if you need to create multiple instances of a class, then a regular class would be more appropriate [Source 1](https://www.baeldung.com/java-anonymous-classes), [Source 2](https://www.developer.com/java/java-anonymous-classes/), [Source 3](https://skillapp.co/blog/demystifying-anonymous-classes-in-java-a-comprehensive-guide/), [Source 4](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/anonymous-class).

1. You set a listener for one component in the controller
2. controller will listen to that msg and tell other component what to do
