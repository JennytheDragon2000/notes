Interfaces in Java are used for multiple reasons:

- **Abstraction**: Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction in Java. They allow you to define a contract for what a class can do without specifying how it will do it. This is done by declaring methods that are abstract by default, meaning they do not have a body and must be implemented by the classes that use the interface [Source 3].

- **Multiple Inheritance**: Java does not support multiple inheritance through classes, but interfaces can be used to achieve a form of multiple inheritance. A class can implement multiple interfaces, which allows it to inherit the abstract methods of all those interfaces [Source 3].

- **Loose Coupling**: Interfaces help in decoupling the code which makes the system more manageable. It hides the implementation details and exposes only the methods that other parts of your program can use [Source 1].

- **Interchangeability and Flexibility**: Interfaces allow you to change the implementation without affecting the code that uses the interface. For example, you can switch out one implementation for another if they both implement the same interface, which is very useful in cases like the Java Collections Framework [Source 0].

- **Polymorphism**: Interfaces support polymorphism, which means that a single interface reference can refer to any of the multiple implementations, allowing for dynamic method dispatch [Source 2].

- **API Design**: Interfaces are fundamental in designing robust and scalable APIs as they define the contract that the implementing classes must adhere to. They are crucial in cases where multiple implementations are possible, such as JDBC API and Jakarta EE API [Source 0].

- **Security**: Interfaces can increase security by hiding the details of class implementation and exposing only what is necessary through the interface methods [Source 3].

- **Constants**: Interfaces can contain constant variables that are public, static, and final by default. These constants can be used by implementing classes [Source 4].

- **Default Methods**: From Java 8 onwards, interfaces can have default methods with a body, which can be inherited by classes without the need for an explicit implementation. This is useful for adding new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing implementations [Source 4].

- **Static Methods**: Also from Java 8, interfaces can have static methods that can be called independently of an object, which can be used for utility or helper methods related to the interface [Source 4].

- **Functional Interfaces**: A special type of interface in Java is the functional interface, which has exactly one abstract method. They are used in lambda expressions introduced in Java 8 [Source 4].

Remember that interfaces cannot have constructors, cannot contain instance fields (other than static final constants), and cannot contain any code that is specific to an implementation. Also, when a class implements an interface, it must provide an implementation for all of the interface's methods unless the class is declared abstract.
