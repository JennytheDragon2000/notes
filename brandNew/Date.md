I dont know.. but I feel like tired with my life lately.. I feel like I'm chasing too many things at once.. I want to achieve too many things at once.. My mind is a huge mess now.. I want to clear it out. I want to figure out how to live my life peacefully.. I should get back on track pretty soon. 

I feel like time is ticking so hard.. what are the things I should do
