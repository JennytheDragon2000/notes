- we can store those in variables 
- ![[Pasted image 20230620093118.png]]
- after that we can manipulate it.

- ![[Pasted image 20230620101751.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620101821.png]]
- we have to specify the index , cuz it returns an array
## select a single element
1. get elements by id
- ![[Pasted image 20230620102029.png]]
2. query selector.
	- here we can use selectors 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230620102507.png]]
	- what are selectors?
		- all the things inside css file are selectors
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620102704.png]]
		- the part we specify before curly bracs `{}` 
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620102838.png]]
		- we can get elements by id, class, element anything...
		- we can combine selectors to get a specific query element.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103130.png]]
		- here we have two links. how can we select one of them by combining selectors
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103214.png]]
		- we we are combining selectors things that occur in the same html tag line, we don't use spaces for them
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103418.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103444.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103505.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103555.png]]
		- what if your query selector selects more than one item
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103750.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103754.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103811.png]]
		- you only get the first item.
		- what if you want to get all the items?
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103844.png]]
		- then you have to use querySelectorAll
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620103904.png]]
		- and from that if you want to get a specific item then you have to use an index.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620104147.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620104206.png]]
		- since javascript use camel case property name's are written not like css
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620104522.png]]
		- it is writtn by using camelCase
		- u can find all the property names by going to this website
		- search html dom style object
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620104613.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20230620104744.png]]

## Separation of Concerns

- Even though we can change all the things in html using javascript. it is a best practice to keep all your code inside css files. And change the classes of each element using javascript
- we can use classlist method to get all the classes 
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115336.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115401.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115421.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115437.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115521.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115534.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115631.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115643.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115645.png]]
## Text Manipulation and Text Content Property
- inner html gives the context inside the tag
-  ![[Pasted image 20230620115925.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115945.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620115953.png]]
-   ![[Pasted image 20230620120005.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230620120102.png]]
- so we can use this to even change html
- ![[Pasted image 20230620120156.png]]
-  ![[Pasted image 20230620120208.png]]
- but here we have to use a string because the value has to be a string. otherwise it will think it is javascript
### Manipulating attributes of each element
- attributes are all the things thats get colored in orange
