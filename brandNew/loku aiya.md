# The Impact of Working Capital Management on the Performance of Listed Manufacturing Companies in the Colombo Stock Exchange

## Introduction
### Background
#### WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Effective management of working capital plays a vital role in both the financial health and operational performance of a company. In today's dynamic business landscape, even if corporations are generating increasing profits, their ability to survive is called into question if they are unable to meet their short-term obligations. Thus, the importance of considering both financial and non-financial factors becomes evident for the sustainability of an organization. Within the realm of corporate finance, three key decisions take center stage: capital structure, capital budgeting, and working capital management. Specifically, working capital management holds significant significance as it directly influences a company's profitability, liquidity, and overall value.

The process of working capital management is designed to ensure the effective functioning of a company by optimizing the utilization of its current assets and liabilities. Its primary objective is to closely monitor the organization's assets and liabilities, thereby facilitating sufficient cash flow to meet short-term business objectives. This process plays a crucial role in managing both planned and unplanned expenses while also assessing the efficiency and liquidity of the business. By implementing efficient working capital management practices, companies can maintain smooth operations and enhance their earnings and profits. In fact, many businesses allocate a significant portion of their cash reserves to working capital, making it reasonable to anticipate that the management of working capital will have a substantial impact on their overall profitability (Deloof, 2003).

Working capital management encompasses the effective control and supervision of various aspects such as inventory management, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Its purpose is to manage and regulate current assets and liabilities in a manner that minimizes the risk of falling short on short-term obligations while avoiding excessive investment in these assets. It holds a significant position within a company's overall strategy to enhance shareholder value. A well-executed working capital management system reflects the financial well-being of a company. The primary objective of working capital management is to ensure a reasonable level of working capital is maintained, striking a balance between inadequacy and excessiveness. Regardless of its size or purpose, every firm, whether profit-oriented or not, requires a certain amount of working capital. Thus, working capital can be viewed as the lifeblood of a firm, and its efficient management is instrumental in ensuring the firm's success and long-term sustainability. Conversely, ineffective management can potentially lead the firm into troublesome situations (Niresh, 2012).

An effective working capital policy has the potential to create value for shareholders, while a poor policy can have detrimental effects on the organization, leading to financial difficulties. This situation may result in disinvestment and the collapse of long-term initiatives, ultimately diminishing shareholder value (Afza & Nazir, 2008). Traditionally, the responsibility for working capital strategies resided with managers in the Accounting and Finance department. However, in today's evolving market, the landscape is changing, and many managers who were not previously involved in the process are now being tasked with taking proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with working capital (Owolabi & Alayemi, 2010).


#### Enhancing the Manufacturing Sector in Sri Lanka: Optimizing Working Capital Management
The manufacturing sector is a significant sub-sector within the industry sector of Sri Lanka, and it has been identified as a major contributor to the country's economic growth (Central Bank Report, 2020). Given its importance in boosting the overall economy, it is crucial to consider manufacturing companies in this study. The selection of manufacturing companies is justified by two factors that enhance the study's validity. Firstly, manufacturing enterprises are ideal candidates for studying working capital management due to the substantial role of inventories, accounts receivable, and payments within the manufacturing industry. This improves the comparability of the sample companies in terms of working capital management. In contrast, service businesses typically maintain lower levels of inventory and accounts receivable, making them less reliable sources of data for this study. Secondly, previous studies on this topic conducted in various countries have predominantly focused on industrial firms (Deloof, 2003; Raheman and Nasr, 2007). Considering these factors, the researcher concluded that manufacturing enterprises are the most suitable entities to address the research objectives effectively.

In the current business landscape, many manufacturing companies are encountering short-term financial difficulties primarily due to insufficient liquidity. Despite generating increasing profits, these companies are unable to maintain adequate cash flow to sustain smooth operations. Moreover, manufacturing firms are particularly susceptible to the impact of working capital management on their financial well-being. They are closely intertwined with macroeconomic factors such as Gross Domestic Production, employment, inflation, saving and investment, consumption, and export and import activities. As a result, efficient working capital management holds immense importance not only for individual companies but also for the overall economy. When a company fails to meet its obligations, it not only disrupts its manufacturing processes but also hampers its overall performance. Thus, the effective management of working capital becomes crucial to ensure the seamless functioning of manufacturing companies and to uphold the broader economic stability.

In Sri Lanka, working capital is widely recognized as the crucial determinant of both profitability and liquidity. However, it is surprising to note that there has been limited research conducted on this important topic within the country. Manufacturing serves as the backbone of the industrial sector and plays a vital role in the national economy. The demand for manufacturing products depends on their nature and the market demand for those specific products. Manufacturing companies also contribute to employment generation by providing opportunities to the underutilized workforce, thereby helping to alleviate poverty in the country. Consequently, manufacturing companies hold significant importance within the socio-economic context of Sri Lanka.

As a developing country, Sri Lanka faces challenges in terms of lacking many industrial resources within the current business environment. This necessitates the importation of technical machinery from developed countries, leading to increased manufacturing costs. Various factors such as inadequate working capital, escalating fuel prices, electricity shortages, high raw material costs, high debt expenses, and tax burdens collectively contribute to the poor performance of the manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, the manufacturing sector plays a crucial role in adding value to the Gross Domestic Product, both quantitatively and qualitatively, which in turn contributes to economic growth. In Sri Lanka, manufacturing productions can be categorized as either domestic consumption or foreign consumption, with the latter driving exports and foreign exchange earnings for the economy. Consequently, this helps strengthen the value of the local currency, the rupee.

Manufacturing companies often encounter significant financial challenges in the course of their operations and business activities. To fulfill their financial requirements, these companies resort to various sources of funding. Among them, bank loans serve as the primary source of funding for the manufacturing sector. Acquiring or leasing heavy machinery requires substantial funds, and to meet day-to-day expenses, companies rely on net working capital, which they typically borrow from banks, incurring interest costs that add to the overall expenses of the manufacturing industry.

However, the manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka is currently facing a decline due to increased costs stemming from a shortage of working capital. This shortage can have adverse effects on both profitability and liquidity. Despite being a vital sub-industry that contributes to the country's economy and generates foreign currency, the manufacturing sector's profitability is being hampered by the escalating costs, mounting debt, and poor management of working capital. As a result, the industry's overall performance is deteriorating.

Working capital management is currently recognized as a significant concern for businesses, and finance executives are actively striving to understand the underlying causes and levels of working capital management (Lamberson, 1995). It falls upon financial managers to accurately estimate the actual working capital requirements, which can be a challenging task given the ongoing pandemic situation and the rapidly changing business environment. The need for working capital varies from one firm to another and is influenced by several factors, including the nature of the business, production cycle and policies, business cycle, credit policies, dividend policy, price level changes, profit level changes, and operating efficiency.

One of the crucial decisions in working capital management revolves around determining how current assets will be financed. There are two types of sources available: short-term and long-term. It is the responsibility of the financial manager to determine the appropriate proportion to be financed by current liabilities and the proportion to be financed by long-term resources. Maintaining an optimum financing mix is essential to enhance shareholder value. This involves striking the right balance in the allocation of resources to ensure efficient working capital management and maximize the overall value for shareholders.

When determining the financing mix, there are three basic techniques: hedging, conservative, and moderate methods. Each approach has its own characteristics and considerations.

The hedging method suggests that long-term funds should be used to finance the permanent portion of current assets, while short-term funds should be allocated for meeting temporary and seasonal requirements. As a result, the short-term debt would be equal to the current assets. This strategy combines high-profit potential with high risk, as it relies on a mix of funding sources.

In contrast, the conservative approach advocates for funding the expected total requirements of current assets primarily through long-term sources. Short-term financing should be utilized only in emergency situations. This strategy offers a lower profit potential but also poses a lower level of risk compared to the hedging method.

Neither the hedging nor the conservative approach can be considered universally suitable for determining the best financing mix. The moderate approach, on the other hand, represents a trade-off between the hedging and conservative approaches. The choice of which approach is most suitable for a particular business depends on the risk profile of the current business operations. It involves carefully assessing the risk factors and striking a balance that aligns with the business's specific circumstances and risk tolerance.

In the current business landscape, many manufacturing firms are grappling with inadequate working capital, while others are burdened with excessive working capital. These challenges significantly impact the profitability and liquidity of companies, ultimately having indirect effects on the overall economic growth of the country.

The objective of this study is to examine the impact of working capital management on the performance of manufacturing companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. Specifically, it aims to establish a connection between working capital management and business success, considering metrics such as Return on Total Assets and Return on Total Equity.

This study will offer recommendations for individuals interested in working capital management. It will help them strike a balance between liquidity and firm performance, ultimately leading to an increase in shareholder value. By optimizing resource utilization and minimizing the cash conversion cycle, firms can gain long-term competitive advantages. This, in turn, is likely to result in higher profitability for the companies involved.

#### Problem statement
Effective working capital management is crucial for the smooth functioning of any business. According to Brigham and Houston (2003), it occupies a significant portion, approximately 60%, of a financial manager's time. Maintaining adequate liquidity in day-to-day operations is a key aspect of managing working capital to ensure the company's operations run smoothly and its obligations are met (Eljelly, 2004).

Padachi (2006) emphasizes the importance of effective working capital management for the success and sustainability of the manufacturing industry. It is seen as a means to improve performance and contribute to overall economic growth. Working capital management involves finding the optimal balance among various components, such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. This approach is essential in a company's overall value creation strategy and provides a competitive advantage (Deloof, 2003).

Various studies have explored the relationship between working capital management and business success. For example, Waithaka (2012) examined the impact of working capital management on the performance of agricultural enterprises listed on India's National Stock Exchange. Mutungi (2010) investigated the link between working capital management and financial performance in Kenyan oil marketing firms. These studies revealed insights into the aggressive working capital policies adopted in specific sectors based on correlation analysis.

Overall, effective working capital management plays a pivotal role in optimizing business operations, ensuring financial stability, and contributing to the success and growth of companies across different industries.

Previous research has explored the impact of optimal inventory management and effective accounts receivable management on maximizing profits (Besley and Meyer, 1987; Lazaridis and Tryfonidis, 2006). Other studies have examined how reducing working capital can enhance a company's profitability (Shin and Soenen, 1998; Deloof, 2003; Padachi, 2006; Raheman and Nasr, 2007).

However, there is a dearth of research specifically focusing on the relationship between working capital management and the performance of manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka. To bridge this gap, the current study aims to investigate this connection. The primary research question for this study is whether working capital management has an impact on the performance of manufacturing companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange in Sri Lanka during the period from 2016 to 2021.

By conducting this study, it is expected to contribute to the existing literature by shedding light on the relationship between working capital management and firm performance in the context of Sri Lankan manufacturing companies. The findings will provide valuable insights for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers, helping them understand the importance of effective working capital management and its implications for the financial performance of manufacturing firms in Sri Lanka.
## RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

### WORKING CAPITAL

The dynamic nature of the globalized business environment poses challenges for organizations, making it complex and difficult to comprehend. Even profitable companies face uncertainties and survival risks due to market inefficiencies. In today's context, many businesses struggle to meet their short-term obligations due to a lack of understanding of working capital management. Working capital, regardless of the size or type of business, is crucial for the liquidity, profitability, solvency, and overall sustainability of an organization (Mukhopadhycy, 2004).

Traditionally, working capital management was primarily the responsibility of accounting and finance managers. However, the evolving economy has shifted this role, and now many managers who were not previously involved in this process are being tasked with proactively reducing the risks associated with working capital (Owolabi & Alayemi, 2010).

In literature, working capital is commonly defined as the difference between current assets and current liabilities (Allende & Preve, 2010). Positive working capital is traditionally seen as a sign of financial strength, while zero working capital indicates the minimum working capital position of a company. Current assets encompass items that can be converted into cash within a year without losing value or disrupting the company's operations, such as inventory, accounts receivable, short-term investments, and cash equivalents. On the other hand, current liabilities consist of obligations that are expected to be settled within a year using the company's current assets or earnings, including accounts payable, tax payable, and short-term financial debts (Owolabi & Alayemi, 2010).


Working capital is often referred to as the lifeblood of a company, similar to how blood is essential for humans (Achchuthan & Kajanathan, 2013). It is the financial resource that enables a company to meet its short-term operating obligations by utilizing both short-term and long-term funds. The financial requirement for day-to-day operations is calculated by subtracting short-term operational liabilities from current assets (Preve & Allende, 2010). This financial need is fulfilled through working capital.

Working capital, also known as circulating capital or floating capital, represents the investment made in current assets. In the current business landscape, many businesses face challenges in meeting their short-term obligations due to a lack of sufficient working capital. Shortages of working capital are often identified as a major reason for the failure of small businesses, both in developing and industrialized countries (Rafue, 1996). These businesses often have limited knowledge and understanding of working capital management, making it a critical issue in the current business context. Working capital is of utmost importance and is considered a life-giving force for an economic entity (Mukhopadhycy, 2010).

In any firm, a financial manager is responsible for making three types of decisions: financing, investing, and distributing dividends. These decisions involve both short-term and long-term considerations. Short-term decisions pertain to the organization's operating capital, which is necessary for day-to-day operations to run smoothly (Arshad & Gondal, 2013). From an operational perspective, working capital can be defined as the sum of inventories and accounts receivables minus accounts payable (Marttones & Montokarri, 2003).

In today's business environment, it is essential for companies to maintain an adequate amount of working capital to fulfill their financial obligations and address short-term crises. Planning for short-term assets is of utmost importance for companies. Working capital plays a critical role in a company's growth and profitability. Insufficient working capital can lead to shortages and challenges in the organization's daily operations (Horne & Wachowicz, 2000).

Furthermore, working capital is defined as the time difference between the expenditure on raw materials and the receipt of revenue from the sale of finished products (Jagongo & Makori, 2013). It represents the funds tied up in the production and sales cycle of a company. Proper management of working capital is crucial for ensuring smooth operations and maximizing profitability.

Determining the appropriate amount of working capital for a company involves assessing its needs in various situations, such as during its initial stage, growth phase, and when it reaches maturity. In the early stages, a new business requires additional working capital to cover expenses related to promotion, production, advertising, and other initial costs. The specific amount of working capital needed will depend on factors like the size and type of the company.

As the company grows and expands, the requirement for working capital also increases. This growth-related working capital is necessary to support the expanding operations and meet the demands of a larger customer base. Eventually, when the company reaches a mature stage, it stabilizes its operations, and the working capital required becomes more predictable. This steady-state working capital is known as normal working capital.

In addition to the growth stage, several other factors influence the need for working capital in a business. These factors include the nature of the business, production cycle, production policy, credit policy, availability of raw materials, profitability, tax levels, dividend policy, depreciation policy, price level changes, and operational efficiency. Each of these factors can impact the working capital requirements of a company.

Overall, determining the optimal amount of working capital involves considering the specific circumstances and characteristics of the business at different stages of its lifecycle, as well as the various factors that affect its working capital needs.

### WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Working capital management plays a crucial role in maximizing shareholder value and is essential for businesses as it impacts both profitability and liquidity. Finance managers and executives need to have a clear understanding of the working capital requirements in order to effectively manage the company's finances.

Managing working capital is not only important for day-to-day operational activities but also for the overall corporate strategy aimed at maximizing shareholder value. It is a fundamental challenge faced by financial executives to determine the key drivers of working capital and the optimal amount needed for the business.

Working capital management can be viewed as the ability of an organization to finance the difference between its short-term assets and short-term liabilities. It involves ensuring that the company has enough liquidity to cover its short-term obligations while also optimizing the utilization of its current assets.

Efficient working capital management enables a company to maintain a balance between its cash flows, inventory levels, and receivables/payables, ultimately leading to improved profitability and liquidity. By effectively managing working capital, companies can enhance their operational efficiency, reduce financing costs, and create value for their shareholders.

Overall, working capital management is a fundamental aspect of financial management, and its effective implementation contributes to the success and financial well-being of a business.

Working capital management is a management accounting approach that focuses on maintaining optimal levels of current assets and liabilities to ensure that an organization has sufficient cash flow to meet its short-term obligations. It is essential for businesses to effectively manage their working capital to ensure timely and adequate fulfillment of their short-term responsibilities.

There are several reasons why working capital management is important. In manufacturing firms, current assets often represent a significant portion of their total assets, sometimes accounting for more than half. Similarly, distribution companies may have even higher levels of current assets. If these current assets are not managed efficiently, it can result in a poor return on investment for the company.

Conversely, companies with insufficient current assets may experience shortages and struggle to maintain smooth operations. They may face difficulties in fulfilling their day-to-day operational requirements, such as paying suppliers, meeting payroll, or managing inventory levels.

By effectively managing working capital, businesses can ensure they have the necessary liquidity to meet their short-term obligations. This involves striking a balance between maintaining adequate levels of cash, inventory, and receivables, while also managing payables and other short-term liabilities. Proper working capital management helps improve the company's overall financial health, cash flow position, and operational efficiency.

Overall, working capital management is crucial for businesses across various industries. It enables them to optimize their financial resources, maintain liquidity, and ensure smooth operations, ultimately contributing to their long-term success and profitability.

It is widely acknowledged that working capital is essential for the survival of any company. Effective management of working capital is crucial for the financial well-being of firms (Padachi, 2006). Working capital management involves the management and control of current assets and liabilities. The main objective is to minimize risks and avoid excessive investment in these assets (Eljelly, 2004). The ultimate goal of working capital management is to strike the right balance among the different components of working capital. The ability of a finance executive to efficiently manage receivables, inventory, and payables is vital for the company's overall performance (Filbeck & Krueger, 2005). Therefore, working capital management plays a critical role in the success of a business. It encompasses all management decisions and actions that influence the size and effectiveness of working capital (Kaur, 2010).

One of the key responsibilities of financial managers is to accurately estimate the working capital requirement and develop a proper plan for its management. The inability of financial managers to effectively plan and manage the current assets and liabilities of their organizations has been linked to a significant number of business bankruptcies (Smith, 1973). Several factors, such as accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and net accruals, influence the working capital requirements of a company. These factors are influenced by the firm's technology, operational efficiency, and sales level (Hawawini et al., 1986). Working capital is comprised of current assets and current liabilities. To determine the optimal amount of working capital, each component needs to be calculated separately. Factors such as the holding periods of different types of inventories, the accounts receivable period, the creditors' payment period, budgeted production and sales, cost of goods produced, cost of sales, average time of wage payment, and other overheads need to be carefully considered when estimating the working capital requirements. Neglecting proper planning for working capital can lead to excessive or inadequate working capital, which can have adverse effects on a firm's operations (Agarwal, 1977).

Working capital management aims to optimize each component of working capital. It is recognized by financial management experts that working capital issues contribute to the low profitability of the manufacturing sector. When working capital is excessive, it can lead to unnecessary purchases and inventory buildup, increasing the risks of theft, waste, and losses. Conversely, insufficient working capital hinders a company's ability to cover its daily operating expenses, resulting in inefficiencies, higher costs, and lower profits. Therefore, effective planning and control of working capital can significantly enhance earning power, particularly when there is an operating margin.

Developing countries often face challenges related to inefficient allocation of resources. In these economies, capital is a scarce and valuable resource, and its effective utilization can accelerate growth, reduce production costs, and enhance the overall efficiency of the production system. Within a company's total capital, both fixed capital and working capital play vital roles. However, working capital management has often been neglected, resulting in underutilization of both working capital and fixed capital. Conversely, effective working capital management can enhance a company's financial resilience and contribute to its sustainable competitive advantage. It ensures that the company can continue its operations and maintain sufficient cash flow to meet short-term debt obligations and cover upcoming operational needs.

### 2.1.3 CASH CONVERSION CYCLE


Working capital, also known as the cash conversion cycle, varies across different businesses. Effective working capital management plays a crucial role in improving cash flow, reducing the need for external financing, and mitigating the firm's risk of default. The cash conversion cycle is a significant aspect of working capital management, representing the average number of days required to convert a dollar spent on raw materials into a dollar collected from a customer (Stewart, 1995). It encompasses the time taken from purchasing raw materials to manufacturing the product and ultimately collecting accounts receivable related to product sales (Besley and Brigham, 2005).

The cash conversion cycle is calculated by summing the days sales outstanding, days of inventory outstanding, and days payables outstanding. There are several strategies to reduce working capital, including improving inventory turnover, accelerating cash collection from sales, and minimizing cash outflows. Companies typically follow a cycle where they purchase inventory, sell items on credit, and then collect accounts receivable (Weston and Brigham, 1977). For manufacturing firms, the cash conversion cycle includes the time spent on processing raw materials and producing the final product. It also considers the time it takes for debtors to settle their liabilities and the time it takes to sell finished goods, thereby reducing the maturity period of accounts payable.

A longer cash conversion cycle necessitates a larger investment in current assets. Conversely, an efficient cash conversion cycle enables the company to meet its financial obligations promptly, enhancing the firm's reputation. A company with a poor cash conversion cycle may struggle to fulfill its financial obligations, leading to financial distress. Therefore, managing the cash conversion cycle effectively is crucial for ensuring the company's financial stability and reputation.

The cash conversion cycle is often employed as an indicator of a company's working capital policy. A longer cash conversion cycle is associated with a defensive working capital policy, while a shorter cash conversion cycle is indicative of an aggressive working capital policy (Arnold, 2008).

To calculate the cash conversion cycle, several components need to be determined: the average collection period, inventory turnover per day, and average payment period.

1. Average Collection Period: This represents the average number of days it takes for the company to collect payments from its customers. It can be calculated by dividing the accounts receivable by the average daily sales.
    
2. Inventory Turnover per Day: This indicates how quickly the company is selling its inventory. It can be calculated by dividing the cost of goods sold by the average inventory.
    
3. Average Payment Period: This represents the average number of days it takes for the company to pay its suppliers. It can be calculated by dividing the accounts payable by the average daily purchases.
    

Once these three components are determined, the cash conversion cycle can be calculated by subtracting the average payment period from the sum of the average collection period and the inventory turnover per day.

Understanding the cash conversion cycle helps assess the efficiency of a company's working capital management and provides insights into its liquidity and operational effectiveness.

### Measuring working capital Management in Literature
#### 2.2.1 EFFICIENT WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.

Efficient working capital management is crucial for the financial performance and overall health of businesses, serving as a key indicator of their financial well-being. However, determining the level of efficiency can be complex and subjective. Various considerations come into play, such as whether it is more cost-effective to extend credit to customers to boost sales or to minimize trade receivables to avoid a cash gap in the cash conversion cycle. Similarly, the question arises whether maintaining higher inventories is efficient to prevent stockouts or whether it leads to excessive cash-lock in working capital. Additionally, delaying payment to suppliers can be seen as a way to manage cash flow, but it may also impact a company's reputation.

Researchers have emphasized the implications of working capital management's efficiency. Effective working capital management is crucial because it significantly impacts profitability, liquidity, and the creation of shareholder value for a company (Richard & Laughlin, 1980; Smith, 1980; Lamberson, 1995; Agha, Mba, & Mphil, 2014). Thus, striking the right balance and optimizing working capital management practices is vital for companies to enhance their financial performance and deliver value to their shareholders.

Efficient working capital management plays a crucial role in creating value for shareholders, as highlighted by Shin and Soenen (1998). The ability of financial managers to effectively handle receivables, inventory, and payables has a significant impact on the overall success and profitability of a company. Osisioma (1997) further emphasizes the importance of establishing a strong connection between the different components of working capital to achieve an efficient mix that ensures capital adequacy.

Managing working capital efficiently involves striking a balance between liquidity and profitability. It entails effectively managing and controlling current assets and obligations in such a way that the risk of defaulting on short-term responsibilities is minimized while avoiding an excessive level of working capital (Uchenna, Mary, & Okelue). This balancing act is crucial for maintaining financial stability and maximizing the value generated by the company.

Efficient working capital management requires careful planning and monitoring to optimize the utilization of resources and minimize risks. By effectively managing working capital, companies can enhance their financial performance, mitigate liquidity risks, and ultimately create value for their shareholders.

Hence, it is crucial for financial managers to actively strive for efficient working capital management in order to enhance the value of the organization. In the manufacturing sector, it is advisable for businesses to engage skilled professionals in finance who can provide expert guidance on effectively managing working capital (Afza, Raheman, Qayyum, & Bodla, 2010). This approach ensures that working capital is utilized optimally, leading to increased operational profitability within the manufacturing sector.

In a study conducted by Ghosh and Maji (2004) on Indian cement companies between 1993 and 2002, the researchers examined the efficiency of working capital management using three index values: performance index, utilization index, and overall efficiency index. This approach allowed for a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of working capital management in these companies.

By adopting such methodologies and focusing on improving efficiency in working capital management, businesses can enhance their financial performance, ensure smoother operations, and create value for stakeholders. It is a continuous process that requires monitoring, analysis, and adjustment to maintain an optimal balance between liquidity and profitability.

Inadequate working capital management has detrimental effects on a company's liquidity and profitability, as funds become tied up in unproductive assets (Akinlo, 2011). This inefficiency also disrupts the balance between cash inflows and outflows, particularly during periods of financial instability, which can further exacerbate the situation for businesses (Niresh, 2012). Inefficient working capital management puts a company at risk of falling into financial pitfalls and crises.

To mitigate these risks and achieve both short-term and long-term organizational goals, it is crucial for all types of firms to prioritize efficient working capital management. By doing so, businesses can optimize their cash flow, enhance liquidity, and maintain a healthy financial position. Effective management of working capital enables companies to navigate financial challenges and remain resilient in the face of uncertainties.

#### 2.2.2 WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENT.

A company's total working capital requirements are influenced by numerous factors that vary across organizations and evolve over time. These factors can be broadly categorized into internal and external factors, each with its own impact on working capital decisions (Paramasivan and Subramanian, 2009).

Internal factors encompass aspects such as the nature of the business, its size, product strategy, credit policy, and growth and expansion plans. These factors are directly controlled by the company and play a significant role in determining its working capital needs.

External factors, on the other hand, are influenced by external forces beyond the company's immediate control. These factors include business fluctuations, technological advancements, availability of infrastructure facilities, import policies, and taxation policies. These external forces can have a substantial impact on a company's working capital requirements.

All of these factors are important and their effects on the company evolve over time. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and consider each relevant component in order to accurately determine the overall investment required in working capital. This analysis enables businesses to effectively manage their working capital and ensure the smooth functioning of their operations.

The concept of net working capital is a useful tool for determining the necessary investment in working capital for a business (Hawawini et al., 1986). According to Hawawini, cash and marketable securities, such as overdrafts and bank payables, are considered purely financial and are not included in the calculation of working capital requirements. Instead, the requirement of working capital is determined by the difference between net working capital and the remaining liquid balance.

The net liquid balance is calculated by subtracting the total value of short-term bank overdrafts and bank notes payable to banks from the total amount of cash and marketable securities. Most companies, depending on their industry, have a substantial investment in operational activities that can be classified as working capital (Hawawini; Viallet & Vora, 1986).

The working capital requirement of a company is influenced by four main components: accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payables, and net accruals. These components are influenced by factors such as the firm's technology, managerial efficiency, and sales level. It is crucial for financial managers to possess a thorough understanding of the working capital requirement in order to make effective decisions.

By accurately assessing the working capital needs and effectively managing its components, financial managers can optimize the company's liquidity and ensure its operational efficiency.


#### 2.2.3 WORKING CAPITAL TECHNIQUES AND PRACTICES FOR

Companies employ various techniques to manage their working capital effectively. These techniques include the intersection of carrying cost and shortage cost, working capital finance policy, cash budgeting, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), and Just-in-Time (JIT) systems. Each of these approaches focuses on different aspects of working capital management, such as cash, inventory, and borrowing from financial institutions.

These working capital management techniques are powerful tools that enable companies to efficiently and effectively manage their working capital. Since both excessive and deficient levels of working capital can have costs for the organization, the objective of these approaches is to determine the optimal amount of working capital.

Excessive working capital incurs carrying costs or interest expenses on the unutilized capital. On the other hand, working capital shortages result in shortage costs, which can include disruptions in production plans and revenue losses. The ultimate goal for any business manager is to find the ideal level of working capital that minimizes both carrying costs and shortage costs.

By implementing these working capital management techniques, companies can strike a balance and optimize their working capital position. This allows them to allocate resources efficiently, maintain liquidity, and maximize their overall financial performance.

Various technologies and methodologies have been employed to identify the optimal level of working capital in organizations. One such technique is the intersection of carrying cost and shortage cost, which aims to minimize the total expenses associated with carrying excess inventory or experiencing shortages. Operational managers should ensure that their inventory levels are maintained below this threshold to avoid unnecessary costs.

Working capital financing policies are also widely used to determine the appropriate financial mix for a company. These policies involve determining the proportion of current assets that should be funded through short-term and long-term sources. Three common approaches to establishing an appropriate financing mix are the hedging approach, conservative approach, and moderate approach.

The hedging approach focuses on balancing short-term and long-term financing sources to mitigate risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and liquidity. The conservative approach leans towards a larger proportion of long-term financing to ensure stability and reduce reliance on short-term debt. The moderate approach strikes a balance between the two, considering both stability and flexibility.

By implementing these techniques and selecting the appropriate financing mix, organizations can optimize their working capital management and achieve a balance between financial stability and operational efficiency.


The hedging method suggests that long-term funds should be utilized to finance the permanent portion of current assets, while short-term funds should be allocated for meeting temporary and seasonal requirements. This approach aims to match short-term debt with current assets, resulting in a financing mix that carries both higher profit potential and higher risk.

On the other hand, the conservative approach recommends that the anticipated total requirements of current assets be financed primarily through long-term sources. Short-term financing should only be used in emergency situations. This strategy prioritizes stability and carries lower profit potential and lower risk.

However, neither the hedging nor the conservative approach is universally suitable for determining the best funding mix. The moderative approach, which represents a trade-off between the hedging and conservative approaches, considers the specific risk profile of the business. Depending on the risk level associated with the company's operations, the moderative approach determines the most suitable funding mix.

Ultimately, selecting the appropriate financing mix for working capital management requires a careful assessment of the business's risk tolerance, profitability goals, and specific operational requirements.

Pandey and Parera (1997) conducted a study in Sri Lanka to explore the working capital management strategies and practices of private industry manufacturing enterprises. The researchers collected data and information through questionnaires and interviews with financial executives from industrial businesses listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.

Their findings revealed that a significant number of Sri Lankan enterprises have informal working capital policies. Additionally, the size of the business was found to influence the overall working capital policy, whether formal or informal, as well as the chosen methodology, which could be conservative, moderate, or aggressive.

The study also indicated that the profitability of the organization has an impact on the methods employed for working capital planning and control. This suggests that the financial performance of the company plays a role in shaping the approach taken towards managing working capital.

These insights highlight the diversity and context-specific nature of working capital management practices within the private industry manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka.

Current assets investment policies play a significant role in working capital management. There are three types of current assets investment policies: relaxed, restricted, and moderative.

A relaxed current assets investment policy involves maintaining a relatively large amount of cash, marketable securities, and inventory. This policy is often accompanied by liberal credit policies that result in a higher level of receivables. While it may offer potential for higher returns, it also carries higher risk (Pinches, 1991; Brigham & Ehrhardt, 2004; Moyer et al., 2005; Gitman, 2005).

On the other hand, a restricted current assets investment policy aims to minimize the holdings of cash, marketable securities, and inventories. This approach is associated with lower risk and return (Gardner et al., 1986; Weinraub & Visscher, 1998).

A moderative current assets investment policy strikes a balance between the relaxed and restricted policies, considering the trade-off between risk and return.

The choice of current assets investment policy is a strategic decision for businesses, and it involves assessing the desired level of risk and return. The literature on working capital management provides ongoing discussions and debates regarding the optimal approach for different organizations.

Cash planning is a crucial strategy in working capital management as it ensures the organization maintains an optimal level of cash. This involves forecasting cash requirements by estimating future receipts and payments. Balancing cash surplus and cash deficit is essential for effective management since both extremes come with costs. By accelerating collections and negotiating more favorable credit terms with creditors, cash requirements can be reduced.

Another important aspect of working capital management is inventory management. Inventory is a significant component of current assets and working capital. Maintaining the right level of inventory can result in substantial cost savings. The economic order quantity (EOQ) model is a widely used approach for inventory management. It helps inventory managers determine the appropriate quantity to order, considering factors such as ordering costs, carrying costs, purchase price, and annual sales.

By effectively managing cash and inventory, businesses can optimize their working capital position and improve overall financial performance. These strategies ensure that the organization maintains sufficient liquidity while minimizing costs and maximizing profitability.

Just-in-time (JIT) is indeed a significant technology that has revolutionized inventory management. Unlike traditional inventory management approaches, JIT aims to eliminate inventory entirely, rather than just reducing costs. It involves procuring raw materials or manufacturing products exactly when they are needed by the customer.

Implementing JIT can be challenging as it requires close coordination and collaboration with suppliers, efficient production processes, and accurate demand forecasting. However, when executed successfully, JIT can significantly minimize inventory costs by avoiding excess stock and associated holding costs.

By adopting a just-in-time approach, companies can achieve greater efficiency, reduce waste, and improve overall productivity. The elimination of inventory not only reduces holding costs but also mitigates the risks of obsolete inventory, stockouts, and associated financial implications. However, it's important to note that implementing JIT requires careful planning and strong partnerships with suppliers to ensure a smooth and uninterrupted supply chain.

#### 2.3 THE EFFECTS OF WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON LIQUIDITY. 

Efficient liquidity management, as described by Eljelly (2004), involves effectively managing and monitoring current assets and liabilities to mitigate risks associated with meeting short-term obligations while avoiding excessive investments in these assets. The management of working capital, also known as liquidity management, plays a crucial role in a company's performance.

When a company struggles to manage its liquidity, it indicates that its current assets are inadequate to fulfill its current liabilities, such as short-term debts. In such situations, the company may need to seek external financing, which can lead to increased financing costs and reduced profitability. Additionally, a poor credit situation resulting from liquidity challenges can increase the risk of insolvency and bankruptcy.

Therefore, it is essential for companies to proactively manage their working capital to ensure that they have sufficient liquidity to meet their short-term obligations. By carefully monitoring and optimizing their current assets and liabilities, companies can minimize the risk of financial difficulties, maintain a healthy credit standing, and enhance their overall financial performance.

Richards and Laughlin (1980) emphasize the significant impact of working capital management on a company's liquidity. They highlight that many businesses with promising future prospects and projected cash flow may still fail if they do not effectively manage their working capital finance. In their analysis, Richards and Laughlin introduce the cash conversion cycle as a valuable indicator of liquidity, in contrast to conventional balance sheet-based measures.

According to their perspective, the cash conversion cycle allows organizations and analysts to focus on the timing of cash inflows and outflows. They argue that this aspect is often overlooked in traditional liquidity measures, where the synchronization of cash inflows and outflows is rarely achieved. By utilizing the cash conversion cycle, which encompasses the time it takes to convert various components of working capital into cash, companies can better control their working capital and ensure that sufficient capital is allocated to maintain liquidity.

In essence, Richards and Laughlin advocate for a more comprehensive approach to liquidity management, one that considers the timing of cash flows. By employing the cash conversion cycle, companies can enhance their understanding of working capital dynamics, optimize cash inflows and outflows, and effectively allocate funds to support liquidity requirements.

Hill and Sartoris (1995) highlight the importance of maintaining an appropriate liquidity position, as it offers several benefits to a company. Firstly, it ensures smoother business operations by providing the necessary resources to meet short-term obligations and fund ongoing activities. This, in turn, enhances the company's overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Furthermore, an adequate liquidity position contributes to increasing shareholder value. When a company can efficiently manage its working capital, it instills confidence in investors and attracts potential shareholders. Shareholders appreciate the stability and financial strength associated with a company that has a strong liquidity position.

Additionally, a favorable liquidity position opens up flexible financing options for the company. Lenders and creditors are more willing to extend credit or provide financing at lower costs when they perceive a company as having sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations. On the other hand, a company with poor liquidity may face difficulties in accessing financing, and if available, it may come at higher interest rates or with stricter terms.

It is worth noting that creditors also pay close attention to a firm's liquidity position. They assess whether the company's current assets are adequate to cover its current liabilities, as this indicates the company's ability to fulfill its financial obligations in a timely manner. Maintaining a favorable liquidity position helps build trust and credibility with creditors, which can positively impact the company's relationships and creditworthiness.

In conclusion, studying and effectively managing working capital management is crucial for a company's day-to-day operations. By maintaining an appropriate liquidity position, companies can ensure smooth operations, enhance shareholder value, and attract favorable financing options, while also instilling confidence in creditors.

Maintaining liquidity is crucial for a company to meet its financial obligations promptly and handle unforeseen circumstances effectively. Lyroudi and Lazaridis (2000) conducted a unique study focusing on the Greek food industry to examine the relationship between the cash conversion cycle and traditional liquidity measures such as the current ratio and quick ratio. The study revealed a significant positive correlation between modern and conventional liquidity indicators. Additionally, the return on assets ratio was found to be positively associated with the cash conversion cycle.

Effective working capital management plays a vital role in ensuring a stable cash flow, which is essential for long-term financial success and profitability (Wignaraja & O'Neil, 1999). In another study conducted by Lyroudi and McCarty (1993) on small US enterprises from 1984 to 1988, they found that the cash conversion cycle was negatively correlated with the current ratio but positively correlated with the quick ratio.

Managing liquidity becomes crucial when there is a trade-off between profit and risk. It involves striking a balance between maintaining sufficient cash reserves to handle unexpected events and crises while also utilizing available funds to generate profits and maximize returns. Liquidity management requires careful consideration of various factors, including the cash conversion cycle, traditional liquidity measures, and the overall financial goals and risk tolerance of the company.

In conclusion, effective liquidity management is essential for a company's financial stability and profitability. It involves understanding the relationship between different liquidity measures, such as the cash conversion cycle, current ratio, and quick ratio, and making informed decisions to strike the right balance between profit generation and risk mitigation.



#### 2.4 THE EFFECT OF WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT ON PROFITABILITY.


In their article titled "Efficiency of Working Capital Management and Company Profitability," Shin and Soenen (1998) were among the pioneers to establish a link between effective working capital management and increased profitability. They conducted a study on a sample of companies listed on the US stock exchange from 1974 to 1994, focusing on the impact of the cash conversion cycle on profitability.

The cash conversion cycle is a measure that calculates the number of days it takes for inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable to be converted into sales. Shin and Soenen (1998) found that by reducing the cash conversion cycle by a significant amount, companies could enhance their profitability. This suggests that efficiently managing working capital, by minimizing the time it takes to convert assets into cash, can have a positive impact on a company's financial performance.

The findings of Shin and Soenen's study highlight the importance of optimizing working capital management practices. By effectively managing inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, companies can improve their cash flow and overall profitability. This emphasizes the need for businesses to focus on efficient working capital management strategies as part of their broader financial management approach.

The impact of working capital management on profitability has gained significant attention in the field of financial management. Studies by Soenen (1993) and Fazzari & Petersen (1993) emphasize the importance of evaluating the relationship between working capital management and profitability, as it is often overlooked in many businesses.

These studies aim to determine the impact of a company's working capital management practices on its profitability, suggesting that the most profitable approach to working capital management is the best one to adopt. Rehman (2006) conducted a study on 94 Pakistani enterprises listed on the Islamabad Stock Exchange (ISE) for the period of 1999-2004. He analyzed various aspects of working capital management, such as average payment duration and the cash conversion cycle, and their influence on the net operating profit of the companies.

The findings of Rehman's study revealed a significant negative relationship between high working capital ratios and company profitability. In other words, excessive levels of working capital were found to have an adverse impact on profitability. On the other hand, Rehman suggested that managers can generate positive shareholder value by reducing the cash conversion cycle to an optimal level. This indicates that efficiently managing working capital, specifically by reducing the time it takes to convert assets into cash, can lead to improved profitability and create value for shareholders.

Overall, these studies highlight the importance of effective working capital management in enhancing profitability. By optimizing working capital levels and improving cash conversion cycles, companies can improve their financial performance and generate positive returns for their shareholders.

The ultimate goal of profitability is to ensure that a company's resources are utilized in the most efficient manner possible. In line with this objective, Padachi (2006) conducted a study focusing on small manufacturing businesses, specifically analyzing the relationship between working capital management and profitability. The study utilized a mature manufacturing firm as a case study and spanned a six-year period from 1998 to 2003.

The study identified independent factors such as payment in days, receivables in days, inventory turnover, and the cash conversion cycle, while the dependent variable was the return on assets (ROA). Regression analysis was employed to determine the final outcomes. The findings revealed that the printing business, which was the subject of the study, managed its profitability by making significant investments in inventory and receivables accounts.

In a separate study by Rehman and Nasir (2007), over ninety enterprises listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) were examined to explore the impact of working capital management on corporate profitability. The study found a negative association between company profitability and working capital management. Additionally, it revealed a positive relationship between company size and profitability, as well as an inverse relationship between leverage liquidity and profitability.

These studies shed light on the complex relationship between working capital management and profitability. While efficient management of working capital can positively impact profitability, other factors such as company size and financial leverage also play a role. Understanding these dynamics can help businesses make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to enhance profitability and overall financial performance.

Mathuva (2009) conducted a study focusing on 30 companies listed on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, covering the period from 1993 to 2008. The researcher employed various statistical techniques such as Pearson and Spearman's correlations, pooled ordinary least squares, and fixed effects regression models for data analysis. The study revealed two significant findings. First, there was a substantial negative relationship between the average collection period and profitability, indicating that a shorter collection period was associated with higher profitability. Second, there was a positive relationship between inventory turnover in days and average payment period with profitability, suggesting that a shorter inventory turnover and longer payment period were linked to higher profitability.

In another study by Akoto, Awunyo, and Angmor (2013), the relationship between working capital management methods and profitability of listed manufacturing enterprises in Ghana was examined. The study utilized data from the annual reports of 13 listed industrial enterprises in Ghana spanning the period from 2005 to 2009. Through panel data methods and regression analysis, the study found a significant negative association between profitability and accounts receivable days. Additionally, the cash conversion cycle, current asset ratio, size, and current asset turnover had a positive impact on profitability. The study recommended that managers focus on limiting accounts receivables to a period of 30 days in order to increase shareholder value.

These studies provide valuable insights into the relationship between working capital management and profitability in different contexts. They highlight the importance of effective management of accounts receivables, inventory turnover, and payment periods in achieving higher profitability for companies. By implementing appropriate working capital management strategies, businesses can optimize their financial performance and create value for shareholders.

Gill, Biger, and Mathur (2010) conducted a study to expand on the findings of Lazaridis and Tryfonidis regarding the relationship between working capital management and profitability. The study focused on a sample of 88 American companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange during the period from 2005 to 2007. The researchers specifically examined the relationship between the cash conversion cycle and profitability, using gross operating profit as the measure of profitability. The results of the study indicated a statistically significant relationship between the cash conversion cycle and profitability. This suggests that effective management of the cash conversion cycle, along with maintaining receivable accounts at an optimal level, can contribute to generating profits for businesses. The study reinforces the importance of working capital management in driving financial performance and underscores the potential impact on profitability through efficient management of the cash conversion cycle.
